06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
This repository contains an OpenWeather API website to retrieve weather information. It shows weathers conditions in different cities, including temperature, wind, humidity. As a student I used the codes given by instructor Bootcamp Columbia University Module 6 Challenge, I was able to update API key. The app contains localStorage to store data.
